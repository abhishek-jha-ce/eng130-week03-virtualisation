### To setup the environment as shown above:

- Navigate to the folder where we want to create the vagrant file and create the `Vagrantfile`:
```
$ nano Vagrantfile

It will create the file and open nano editor, where we can edit the file.
```
**Note**: To Save in `nano editor` use `CTRL + O` and to exit use `CTRL + X`
