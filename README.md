# Virtualisation

Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware.

- It refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously.
- For the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it appears as if they are on their own dedicated machine.


## Virtual Machine 

A virtual machine is the emulated equivalent of a computer system that runs on top of another system.

To make use of virtuallisation, we need the following tools installed in our localhost.
- SSH
- Git
- Bash
- Ruby - dev-kit is required for Vagrant
- VirtualBox
- Vagrant

Check the *installation.MD* file to see how to install **Ruby**, **Vagrant**, and **Virtual Box**.

## Setting up the Development Environment using "Vagrant - Virtual Box"

### What is a development environment?

- Dev environments are virtual machines running either in the local data center, in the cloud or a hybrid combination of these. We can use these machines for software development instead of our local machine.
- The local machine works as a frontend. It runs only a thin client that is connected to a dev environment. 
- The dev environment works as a backend.

</p>

### To setup the environment as shown above:

- Navigate to the folder where we want to create the vagrant file and create the `Vagrantfile`:
```
$ nano Vagrantfile

It will create the file and open nano editor, where we can edit the file.
```
**Note**: To Save in `nano editor` use `CTRL + O` and to exit use `CTRL + X`

- Add the following code in the `Vagrantfile`, to create a new Ubuntu Virtual Machine. The `Ruby` code instructs the `Virtual Box` to create a new VM via `Vagrant`.
```
# creating a VM with Linux OS using Ubuntu 16.04LTS

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

 config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
```
- To make sure we have saved it correctly we can use `cat` command on the `bash` to check it again.
```
$ cat Vagrantfile
# To Create a Virtual Machine using Vagrant, We need
# Virtual box
# Vagrant - $vagrant --version - to test it
# ruby - dev-kit $ruby --version - to test it

# creating a VM with Linux OS using Ubuntu 16.04LTS

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

 config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
# Creating a Virtual Machine using Ubuntu


end
```
- Now, to create the virtual machine using the above configuration, we run the command `vagrant up`
```
$ vagrant up
```
It will take some time to load up the `Virtual Machine`. If we don't get any error in the terminal, then the VM is set up. There are 2 ways to check if it is set up correctly.

1. Through Virtual Box - We can see a running Virtual Machine in the Virtual Box.

2. Through the `git bash terminal` by typing the command `vagrant status`.

```
$ vagrant status
Current machine states:

default                   running (virtualbox)

The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
simply run `vagrant up`.
```

- Now the virtual machine is created. To to to the virtual machine we use the command `$ vagrant ssh`

```
$ vagrant ssh

New release '18.04.6 LTS' available.
Run 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.

vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$
```

**Note**: the `pwd` should now show `/home/vagrant` as we are inside the VM.

- To check for internet connectivity for our VM, we can use the following to commands:

```
sudo apt-get update      # It downloads the package information from all configured sources
sudo apt-get upgrade -y  # It install available upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system. y flag is for confirmation, if required.
```
- We have a working VM with internet connectivity, we can now download and install `nginx` in our VM.
- Inside the Virtual Machine we can use the command `sudo apt-get install nginx -y`to install `nginx`.
- We can check the status by running `sudo systemctl status nginx` command.
```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ sudo systemctl status nginx
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: en
   Active: active (running) since Tue 2022-10-18 17:10:08 UTC; 7min ago
 Main PID: 12424 (nginx)
   CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
           ├─12424 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_pr
           ├─12426 nginx: worker process
           └─12427 nginx: worker process

Oct 18 17:10:08 ubuntu-xenial systemd[1]: Started A high performance web server

```
- We can use the same `sudo systemctl` command for other tasks.
```
sudo systemctl start nginx    # Start nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx  # Restart nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx     # Start nginx
```

- We don't have a browser available in our VM. To see the `nginx` in the browser, add the following line of code to the `Vagrantfile`:
```
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"
```
The **updated** `Vagrantfile` will look like this:
```
$ cat Vagrantfile
# To Create a Virtual Machine using Vagrant, We need
# Virtual box
# Vagrant - $vagrant --version - to test it
# ruby - dev-kit $ruby --version - to test it

# creating a VM with Linux OS using Ubuntu 16.04LTS

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

 config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
# Creating a Virtual Machine using Ubuntu

# Adding a private network for nginx, and specifying its ip
 config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"

end
```
- Now we have made the changes to the file, we have to exit out of our VM and reload the vagrant from our localhost, the same location the `Vagrantfile` is stored.
- To exit from the VM, we use the `exit` command.
```
$vagrant reload   # To relaod the VM
$vagrant ssh      # To login back to the Virtual Machine
```
- If the above command doesn't work. We can try
```
$vagrant destroy  # To kill the current vagrant process
$vagrant up       # To run the Virtual Machine
$vagrant ssh      # To login back to the Virtual Machine
```
- If this also doesn't work, We have to manually delete the `.vagrant` folder using `rm -rf .vagrant`
```
$rm -rf .vagrant  # To manually delete the .vagrant folder (forcefully)
restart the localhost
$vagrant up       # To run the Virtual Machine
$vagrant ssh      # To login back to the Virtual Machine
```

- Once we have the `nginx` up and running, we can check it from the browser by entering `192.168.10.100`. This is the `ip address` we specified for `nginx` in the `Vagrantfile`

## Syncing file from Localhost to Virtual Machine
- Exit out of the Virtual Machine if inside Virtual Machine by typing `exit`.

- In `Vagrantfile` add the following line of code:
```
 config.vm.synced_folder "app/", "/srv/app", create: true
 config.vm.synced_folder "environment/", "/srv/environment", create: true 
```
- The first parameter is the **relative path** of the location of the folder in the **local host**.
- The Second parameter is the **absolute path** of the location of the folder in the **Virtual Machine**.
- We add an option **create:boolean**. If it is true, the host path will be created if it does not exist. Default is false. 
 
 **Note**: Make sure to save the `vagrantfile`
